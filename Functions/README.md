# Pre-process data

## Peduce dimension original data set using PCA
the data set is so large that Principle Component Analysis is necessary to reduce dimension. the corresponding code is in the PCA directory. Running the program takes up a big memory but the program need executing for only once.

# Generate the training data set and test data set
date_preprocessing.py is to generate 


## Prediction
>svm.py in SVM directory.
>logistic.py in LR in LR directory.
>mlp.py in MLP in MLP directory.

## result drawing
>the drawing data generator program is plot_xx_data.py
>the drawing program is plot_xx.py
